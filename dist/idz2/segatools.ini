[dns]
; Insert the hostname or IP address of the server you wish to use here.
; Note that 127.0.0.1, localhost etc are specifically rejected.

; Region code on the emulated AMEX board DS EEPROM.
; 1: Japan
; 4: Export (some UI elements in English)

; Tell segatools to generate an aime.txt instead of felica.txt
; Necessary for IDZ Version 2+
aimeGen=1

[netenv]
; Simulate an ideal LAN environment. This may interfere with head-to-head play.
; SEGA games are somewhat picky about their LAN environment, so leaving this
; setting enabled is recommended.
enable=1

[keychip]
; The /24 LAN subnet that the emulated keychip will tell the game to expect.
; If you disable netenv then you must set this to your LAN's IP subnet, and
; that subnet must start with 192.168.

[gpio]
; Emulated Nu DIP switch for Distribution Server setting.

; If multiple machines are present on the same LAN then set this to 1 on
; exactly one machine and set this to 0 on all others.

[io3]
; Input API selection for JVS input emulator.
; Set "xinput" to use a gamepad and "dinput" to use a steering wheel.
mode=xinput
; Automatically reset the simulated shifter to Neutral when XInput Start is
; pressed (e.g. when navigating menus between races).
autoNeutral=1
; Use the left thumbstick for steering instead of both on XInput Controllers.
; Not recommended as it will not give you the precision needed for this game
singleStickSteering=0
; Adjust scaling for steering wheel input.
;
; This setting scales the steering wheel input so that the maximum positive
; and minimum negative steering inputs reported in the operator menu's input
; test screen do not exceed the value below. The maximum possible value is 128,
; and the value that matches the input range of a real cabinet is 97.
;
; NOTE: This is not the same thing as DirectInput steering wheel movement
; range! Segatools cannot control the maximum angle of your physical steering
; wheel controller, this setting is vendor-specific and can only be adjusted
; in the Control Panel.

; Name of the DirectInput wheel to use (or any text that occurs in its name)
; Example: TMX
;
; If this is left blank then the first DirectInput device will be used.

; Leave blank if you do not have a positional shifter; a positional shifter

; Example: T500
shifterName=
; Pedal mappings. Valid axis names are:
