[amvideo]
; Enable stub `amvideo.dll`. Disable to use a real `amvideo.dll` build.
; Note that you must have the correct registry settings and `amvideo.dll` version matching your GPU vendor.
; (These DLLs make use of vendor-specific APIs.)
enable=1


[clock]
; Make the system time zone appear to be JST.
; SEGA games malfunction in strange ways if the system time zone is not JST.
; There should not be any reason to disable this hook other than possible implementation bugs.
timezone=1

; Experimental time-of-day warping hook that skips over the hardcoded server maintenance period.
; Causes an incorrect in-game time-of-day to be reported.
; Better solutions for this problem exist and this feature will probably be removed soon.
timewarp=0

; Allow game to adjust system clock and time zone settings.
; This should normally be left at `0`, but the option is provided if you need it.
writeable=0


[dns]
; Enables modification of NAOMI network hostnames.
enable=1

; Controls hostname of all of the common network services servers, unless overriden by a specific setting below.
; Most users will only need to change this setting.
; Also, loopback addresses are specifically checked for and rejected by the games themselves.
; This needs to be a LAN or WAN IP (or a hostname that resolves to one).
default=localhost

; Overrides the target of the `aime.naominet.jp` host lookup.
; Leaving this empty will use the value from the `default` setting.
; aimedb=

; Overrides the target of the `ib.naominet.jp` host lookup.
; Leaving this empty will use the value from the `default` setting.
; billing=

; Overrides the target of the `tenporouter.loc` and `bbrouter.loc` hostname lookups.
; Leaving this empty will use the value from the `default` setting.
; router=

; Overrides the target of the `naominet.jp` host lookup.
; Leaving this empty will use the value from the `default` setting.
; startup=


[hwmon]
; Enable hwmon emulation. Disable to use the real hwmon driver.
; The real implementation of this driver monitors CPU temperatures by reading from Intel Model Specific Registers.
; Reading these registers is an action that is only permitted from kernel mode.
enable=1


[misc]
; Enable setting of miscellaneous registry keys.
enable=0


[netenv]
; Enable network environment virtualization.
; You may need to disable this if you want to do any head-to-head play on your LAN.
; SEGA games are somewhat picky about their LAN environment, so leaving this setting enabled is recommended.
; Note: The virtualized LAN IP range is taken from the emulated keychip's `subnet` setting.
enable=1

; The final octet of the local host's IP address on the virtualized subnet.
; (For example: if the keychip subnet is `192.168.32.0` and this value is set to `11`,
; the local host's virtualized LAN IP is `192.168.32.11`).
addrSuffix=11

; The final octet of the default gateway's IP address on the virtualized subnet.
routerSuffix=1

; The MAC address of the virtualized Ethernet adapter. The exact value should never matter.
macAddr=01:02:03:04:05:06


[keychip]
; Enable keychip emulation. Disable to use a real keychip.
enable=1

; Keychip serial number.
; Keychip serials observed in the wild follow this pattern: `A6xE-01Ayyyyyyyy`.
id=A69E-01A88888888

; Override the game's four-character model code (e.g. `AAV2` for Nu 2)..
; Changing this from the game's expected value will probably just cause a system error.
; Check `common.md` for details on known model codes.
; gameId=

; Override the keychip's region code.
; Probably only affects the system software and not the game software.
; Bit values are:
;  - 1: JPN: Japan
;  - 2: USA (unused)
;  - 3: EXP: Export (for Asian markets)
;  - 4: CHS: China (Simplified Chinese?)
region=1

; An 8-bit bitfield of unclear meaning.
; Changing this doesn't seem to have any effect on anything other than Project DIVA.
systemFlag=0x64

; The LAN IP range that the game will expect.
; The prefix length is hardcoded into the game program: for some games this is `/24`, for others it is `/20`.
subnet=192.168.100.0


[pcbid]
; Enable Windows host name virtualization.
; This is only needed for ALLS-platform games, but it does no harm on games that run on earlier hardware.
enable=1

; Set the Windows host name.
; This should be an ALLS MAIN ID, without the hyphen (which is not a valid character in a Windows host name).
serialNo=ACAE01A99999999


[vfs]
; Enable redirection of Windows paths.
enable=1

; Configure the location of the SEGA AMFS volume.
; Stored on the `E` partition on real hardware.
amfs=F:\

; Configure the location of the SEGA "APPDATA" volume (nothing to do with the user's `%APPDATA%` directory).
; Stored on the `Y` partition on real hardware.
appdata=G:\

; Configure the location of the "Option" data mount point.
; This mount point is optional (hence the name, probably) and contains minor over-the-air content updates.
option=

[ds]

; It is not normally written to outside of inital factory provisioning of a Sega Nu.
enable=1

;  - `1`: Japan
;  - `2`: USA? (Dead code, not used)
;  - `4`: Export
;  - `8`: China
region=1

; MAIN ID serial number. First three characters are hardware series:

; Disable to use the JVS port on a real AMEX.
enable=1


[sram]
; Enable emulation of the AMEX PCIe battery-backed SRAM that stores bookkeeping state and settings.
; This file is automatically created with a suitable number of zero bytes if it does not already exist.

[aime]
; Enable Aime card reader assembly emulation.

; **This does not currently work**.
aimePath=DEVICE\aime.txt

; Path to a text file containing a FeliCa e-cash card IDm serial number.

; Whether to generate a random FeliCa ID if the file at `felicaPath` does not exist.
felicaGen=1

; Defines the input that should be **held** in order to simulate the scanning of an IC card.
; The type of card that is scanned depends on the presence of the above configured ID files.
; The value of this setting should be a Windows virtual-key code. The default is 0x0D (VK_RETURN).
scan=0x0D
