; Each "packet" starts with 0xE0 as a sync. To avoid E0 appearing elsewhere,

; it and use the next sent byte plus one instead.
;
; After the sync is one byte for the board number that was updated, followed by
; the red, green and blue values for each LED.
;
; Board 0 has 53 LEDs:
;   [0]-[49]: snakes through left half of billboard (first column starts at top)
;   [50]-[52]: left side partition LEDs
;
; Board 1 has 63 LEDs:
;   [0]-[59]: right half of billboard (first column starts at bottom)
;   [60]-[62]: right side partition LEDs
;
; Board 2 is the slider and has 31 LEDs:
;   [0]-[31]: slider LEDs left to right, alternating between keys and dividers
